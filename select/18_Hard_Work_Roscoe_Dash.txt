I work hard, I work hard,
I work hard, I work hard
Got my pockets so fat and I'm smoking on loud
Them haters gonna hate but they can't do nothing about it
It's been a long time coming and I ain't never going back
But in 25 8 but it got me where I'm at, I work hard

Great into austin, shitting on all the has beens
No magic carpet, no genie needed, word to aladdin
Since I came up I made a lot of mad men
And talked... stones equipped with glass tints
Now... shout out to those I hurted you
Can't stop what's destined to be so smoke a blunt or two
Take the initiative take know of what's in front of you
Cause me and my crew, we win, we number one in...
I'm living proof that dreams can become reality
The way they talk about me, you would have thought there's no one bad as me
But now that I done blew up and got poured like a cavity
I'm running this shit like 4 legs and 3 cavalry
I work hard, pay off, plus the evidence
Fuck the game like I'm tryna have eleven kids
Make the negative become so irrelevant, I do
And after that the rest become so effortlessly
Like kicks from bruce lee and there ain't no nigga out here do it like me
So I'm out here tryna get it even got it overseas
It's hard work to be awesome, but awesome I be, amen

I work hard, I work hard,
I work hard, I work hard
Got my pockets so fat and I'm smoking on loud
Them haters gonna hate but they can't do nothing about it
It's been a long time coming and I ain't never going back
But in 25 8 but it got me where I'm at, I work hard

... you fucking 9 to 5 in that barry... check
I'm get my own shit, I don't need nobody else
Hard work pays off it takes time to progress
Life is full of ups and downs and I ain't settling for less
Life is what you make it, you wanna go and take it
It don't happen over night, it all started in the basement
I work hard to be the man, and I be damned if I wasted
... fly when I wanna spend every night faded, I do
Those who have obtained, the lesson can do the same
Those who haven't stick to average and active simple and plain
I'm just leading by example the sample of growth and...
So when you see me on the tv don't hate me, just do the same

I work hard, I work hard,
I work hard, I work hard
Got my pockets so... and I'm smoking on loud
Them haters gonna hate but they can't do nothing about it
It's been a long time coming and I ain't never going back
But in 25 8 but it got me where I'm at, I work hard
